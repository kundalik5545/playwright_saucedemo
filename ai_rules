# AI Rules

This file contains rules for AI assistants working on this project.

1. **Code Style**: Use standard JavaScript with ES6+ features.
2. **Playwright**: Use the Page Object Model (POM) for all tests.
3. **Selectors**: Prefer user-facing attributes (text, role, label) over CSS classes or IDs where possible. Use `data-test` attributes if available.
4. **Assertions**: Use `expect` from `@playwright/test`.
5. **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, but keep code self-documenting.
6. **Environment**: Respect the environment configuration (QA, Dev, Prod).
